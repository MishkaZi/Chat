# Chat Application

This project demonstrates a real-time chat application using Node.js, PHP, and MongoDB. The chat messages are sent from the client through a Node.js server using Socket.IO, processed and stored in MongoDB via a PHP backend, and then the results are sent back to the Node.js server and then to the client.
